I am a dedicated and hardworking individual currently pursuing a Master's degree in Economics at the University of Copenhagen. My interests lie in the intersection of economics, data analysis, and business strategy. In my spare time, I enjoy engaging in different kinds of sports activities, reading books, and spending time with friends. If you are interested in discussing how I can add value to your organization, please feel free to contact me.
